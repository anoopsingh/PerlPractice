Interview Questions

    1. A file containing words. They asked me to write a program to find out most 5 repeating words.

    2. Provided a set of characters and a list of words, how many of those words can we create from the input characters ?

    input:
    chars = 'atuslirabocynkebbterasiuaracnbawp'
    words = ['car','boat','plane','bus','shuttle']

    output:
    car => 2

    a) you have to count the character and create a histogram in alphabetical order.
    b) now you have to produce a histogram with max 80 character in line in reference to max count
    c) now same out based histrogram based on the character count

    You have datastructure
    my $users = [
        {
            name => 'John',
            score => 10,
        },
        {
            name => 'Bob',
            score => 1,
        },
        {
            name => 'Carlos',
            score => 5
        },
        {
            name => 'Alice',
            score => 5,

        {
            name => 'Donald',
            score => 7
        }
    ];
    now u have to arrange the name with highest to lower score,
    if score is same than in alphabetical order

    #expected output:
    # John
    # Donald
    # Alice
    # Carlos
    # Bob  

my %hash = () ;
foreach (@$users) {
    $hash{$_->{name}} = $_->{score};
}

foreach (sort {$hash{$b} <=> $hash{$a}} keys %hash ) {
    print "$_\n";
}


map{ $_->{name } } reverse sort { $a->{score} <=> $b->{score} } @$users
map{ $_->{name } } reverse sort { $a->{score} == $b->{score} ? $b->{name} cmp $a->{name} : $a->{score} <=> $b->{score} } @$users









my $users = [
       { name => 'John', score => 10, },
       { name => 'Bob', score => 1, },
       { name => 'Carlos', score => 5 },

After the initial contact by recruiter I got phone interview with two programming tasks. Tasks were not so easy as expected. First one was to implement random function as it's implemented in Java. The second one was to present some sum of cash with the fixed bills of 1$, 2$, 5$, 10$ and 50$. For both I had about 20 minutes which and then I had time to ask questions about the company. All in all it was very interesting interview but I haven't passed at the end.


Find the longest string that contains all the characters (in a given array of characters)  



    Implement a function nondecreasing_subsequences() that, given a sequence of numbers such as:

     [ 3,6,61,6,7,9,1,7,7,2,7,7,2,388,3,72,7 ]

    ... will identify and return each contiguous sub-sequence of non-decreasing numbers. E.g. this example input should return this array-of-arrays (e.g. or list-of-lists)

     [ [3,6,61],[6,7,9],[1,7,7],[2,7,7],[2,388],[3,72],[7] ]

    (Each array includes a sequence of numbers that do not get smaller. The original order is unchanged.) For a visual example of a non-decreasing, see:

    Implement a function all_anagram_groups() that, given many input strings, will identify and group words that are anagrams of each other. An anagram is word that is just a re-arrangement of the characters of another word, like "reap" and "pear" and "a per" (whitespace is ignored). But "pear" and "rep" are not, since "rep" does not have an "a". Also, "the" and "thee" are not anagrams, because "the" only has one… Show More
